# Terrform burst example

The example architecture (see below) is designed to burst a series of virtual servers into IBM Cloud using an existing network, security architecture. The configuration for this architecture deploys virtual machines as multi-tenant instances into a defined datacenter. Selection of the number of virtual servers may be parameterized based on your preference to select the value at deployment time.
